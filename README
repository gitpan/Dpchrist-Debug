NAME
    Dpchrist::Debug - debugging convenience routines

DESCRIPTION
    This documentation describes module revision $Revision: 1.43 $.

    This is alpha test level software and may change or disappear at any
    time.

  SUBROUTINES
   ddump
        ddump LIST,ARRARREF,ARRARREF
        ddump ARRAYREF,ARRAYREF

    Similar to dprint(), except that last two arguments are passed through
    to Data::Dumper->Dump(). Returns LIST.

    Calls warn() if Dpchrist::File::Append::fappend() fails.

    Calls confess() on error.

   debug_enabled
        debug_enabled

    Walks the call stack (outer loop) and inheritance chain (inner loop)
    recursively, examining the __PACKAGE__::DEBUG environment variable,
    until DEBUG is reached. Returns the first defined value found, or
    '*STDERR' if no defined value was found.

   dprint
        dprint LIST
        dprint

    Appends LIST to file name and/or file handle destinations specified as
    colon-delimited list returned by debug_enabled(), and returns LIST.

    Calls warn() if Dpchrist::File::Append::fappend() fails.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

    All of the subroutines may be imported by using the ':all' tag:

        use Dpchrist::Debug         qw( :all );

    See 'perldoc Export' for everything in between.

    Complete:
